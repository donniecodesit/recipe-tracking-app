# Recipe Tracking Application
This application allows users to view, manage, and list recipe ideas on a webpage with a temporary database, and includes form elements and images.
This was built using JavaScript, React, and Test Driven Development. I worked on this during Week 7 of my Software Engineering Course at Thinkful.

## How to install
1. Either clone, fork, or download and unzip this repository to a new folder on your computer.
2. Open a terminal inside of the new folder and run `npm install`, which will install all of the required modules.
3. Afterwards, run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser. Enjoy! :)

### Notes
The database that recipes are stored so is temporary and stored in memory instead of a file. It will stay intact as long as you are on the page, but as soon as it is reloaded, it will default back to it's initial state.
